# 3d-animation
A python program that creates animations of rotating 3d figures. More complex truncated figures can be created.
A shape list is created which stores both the vertices of a 3d figure and the edges, which are implemented as an adjacency list.
Rotations are done through matrix multiplication
Truncation is done through a complicated, but straightforward procedure that is somewhat documented in code.

To use the program, you need to create a folder called pics in your working directory.
